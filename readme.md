# UIBK PS Parallel Systems (703078, 2021)

This repository contains material required to complete exercises for the
Parallel Programming lab in the 2021 summer semester, including assignment
sheets and any associated materials. Note that some of this material is based
on previous years.

**Make sure to read this document carefully, as it contains vital information
regarding the grading of exercises.**

## Topics

Generally, topics discussed here include
 - parallel programming concepts
 - shared memory parallelization using OpenMP
 - performance-oriented programming
 - proper experiment orchestration and benchmarking
 - parallel programming tools

## Schedule

This schedule gives you an overview of the topics we will discuss on each date.
It will be updated continuously throughout the semester. Note that exercises
associated with a given date are to be discussed on that day, i.e., solutions
for that assignment have to be handed in via OLAT by 17:00 on the previous day
(Mondays).

## General Information

All programming exercise solutions you hand in **must** compile and run on the
LCC2 cluster as described in the [LCC2 tutorial](lcc2_tutorial.md). One way
way of ensuring this is by developing on LCC2 directly, either through a
terminal or using an editor/IDE with support for remote development via SSH
(such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)).

Note that the default version of the GCC compiler present on LCC2 is _very_
outdated. You may load a never version by calling `module load gcc/8.2.0`.

**As the tutorial states, use job scripts to run your applications on LCC2
compute nodes, do NOT run applications directly on the LCC2 login node.**

### Connecting to LCC2 via SSH

**NOTE**: You have to be inside the University network to be able to connect via
SSH. See [here](https://www.uibk.ac.at/zid/netz-komm/vpn/) for more information.

The hostname of LCC2 is `lcc2.uibk.ac.at`.

### Coding Guidelines

All programming exercises are conducted in C or C++.

Your code should always compile without warnings, when passing the flags `-Wall
-Wextra -Werror -std=gnu11`. Error handling is your discretion, but wherever you
do or do not include error handling you need to be able to justify it.

Make sure your code is properly formatted using either your IDE/Text editor of
choice, or by using a tool such as `clang-format`. You can find an example
[.clang-format](.clang-format) file in this repository. **Failure to
consistently format code may result in lower scores.**

Try to write _self-documenting code_ by choosing descriptive variable and
function names. While you may want to add comments to certain sections of your
code, try to avoid trivial comments such as `fopen(...); // open file`. The best
source code comments are the ones you do NOT need to write. **All names and
comments should be written in English**.

Finally, all submitted code must be accompanied by a GNU Makefile. That is, your
solution must be able to be compiled with a single call to `make`. You can find
an example Makefile and more information [here](example_makefile).
